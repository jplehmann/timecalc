TimeCalc
========
A simple timesheet calculator for adding up hours worked.  You can see a live version here: http://timecalc.herokuapp.com

I designed this to have a small app to tinker with JavaScript and related technologies. 

* [Knockout] and for model view-viewmodel binding
  * typical binding to observables (cells), computed observables (cells) and
    observable arrays (rows)
  * event binding for click button and blur events
  * declarative CSS behavior for validation of row totals
* [JQuery] for UI behavior
* [Bootstrap] for styling
* [Moment] for time parsing
* [Require] for modular script loading
* [Jasmine] for BDD specification tests
* [Heroku] for hosting using a thin Ruby [Rack] layer
* [Underscore] for functional constructs

Backlog
-------
* Dropdown to select rounding options (around at week-end or total)
* date column on left where user enters first, and rest are inferred?
* allow entering totals without times?
* tool tips on headers with help
* garbage times should not convert ("kjsdf" or "900")
* should leave break times there, normalized??
* times like "900"
* see bugs in issue tracker

Completed
---------
- conversion to Knockout
- object oriented
- should display 5 rows with 3 columns
- should label rows: day 1, day 2, ...
- should display 3 column headers: Time In, Time Out, Break Length
- alignment in input fields should be on right side
- after each focus change, should update hours for each day after entered
- after each focus change, should compute total hours for entire week
- clicking on an item should select it
- start w focus in first field
- entering any invalid number in break field wipes it out and its value is 0
- a total negative time makes the total go red to indicate an error
- valid times must be for in and out else no total is shown for that row (and its value is 0)
- fields 1 and 2 are interpreted as times and field 3 as a duration
- should understand time formats: 9, 9p, 9pm, 9:15, 9:15pm, 9:15p
- out time less than in time should result in error; highlighting in red
- if out is less than in, infer PM unless merdiem was explicitly stated
- replace the time with the normalized time so there is no confusion on what was selected
- limit the precision on any number to 2 decimal places
- BDD spec tests with Jasmine
- should return undefined for junk not 12am
- When visiting the page, should be able to see directions: â€¦
- When visiting the page, should be one row displayed at first
- After filling out the last valid row, another is added
- Should be able to click a button to clear to start over (reload?)
- Deploy to host environment (Heroku)
